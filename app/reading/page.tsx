          The Covid pandemic is what sparked my interest for reading, giving me more time to explore things I had not before. 
          Since then, I have not looked back. Recently, I also invested in an e-reader, which has transformed my reading experience.
          Now, I can read effortlessly during my commutes to school or unwind with a good book before going to bed. 
          Following are some books I've read, re-read, and recommend.
